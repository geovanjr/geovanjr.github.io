I recently co-authored a paper by Y.M. Varela on CBT (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy) and depression, where we show that a 16-week group CBT decreased depressive and anxiety symptoms while improved sleep quality in a young-adult sample of mild depressed volunteers.
As expected this is more pronounced in remitted participants.

We also show that improvements in sleep quality and salivary cortisol reach values similar to a healthy control.
